--Objective--
Analyze the given text to extract structured information about entities and their relationships.

--Entity Extraction Rules--
1. Identify explicit entities with:
 - PER (Person): Full names or unambiguous references to individuals.
 - ORG (Organization): Names of companies, institutions, or groups.
 - GPE (Geo-Political Entity): Countries, cities, states.
 - LOC (Location): Geographical entities (mountains, rivers).
 - FACILITY: Human-made structures (buildings, airports).
 - EVENT: Named events or conferences.
 - PRODUCT: Commercial products or services.
 - WORK_OF_ART: Titles of creative works (books, movies, art).
 - LAW: Legal documents, regulations, or treaties.
 - LANGUAGE: Names of languages or dialects.
 - DISEASE: Medical conditions or symptoms.
 - DATE: Specific calendar dates.
 - NUMERIC: Numerical values (quantities, percentages).
 - Other: Any additional or domain-specific entities not covered above.

2. For each entity:
   - Use exact textual mentions
   - Merge coreferent mentions (e.g., "Dr. Smith" and "the Professor")
   - Avoid inferences not explicitly stated
   - Contextual Description: A concise phrase summarizing the entity's role or attributes in the text.
   - Format: [entity | ID | Type | Exact Mention | Contextual Description]

--Relationship Extraction Rules--
1. Identify only explicitly stated relationships with:
   - Action verbs indicating interaction
   - Spatial/temporal prepositions
   - Possessive constructions
   - Membership indicators

2. Relationship requirements:
   - Both entities must be previously identified
   - Use canonical verb forms (active voice)
   - Maintain original text directionality
   - Evidence Span: The shortest contiguous text span that supports the relationship.
   - Format: [relation | SourceID | RelationType | TargetID | EvidenceSpan]


--Validation Rules--
1. Strictly prohibit:
   - External knowledge inclusion
   - Negated relationships
   - Hypothetical statements

--Examples--
Text: "Dr. Smith, CEO of TechCorp, announced the launch of the new product, QuantumX, at the NY Summit on May 5, which was attended by 500 participants."
Entities:
[entity | E1 | PER | "Dr. Smith" | CEO of TechCorp]
[entity | E2 | ORG | "TechCorp" | Company employing Dr. Smith]
[entity | E3 | PRODUCT | "QuantumX" | New product launched by TechCorp]
[entity | E4 | EVENT | "NY Summit" | Event attended by 500 participants]
[entity | E5 | DATE | "May 5" | Specific date mentioned]
[entity | E6 | NUMERIC | "500" | Number of participants]
Relations:
[relation | E2 | employs | E1 | "CEO of TechCorp"]

--Objective--
Extract entities and their relationships from the given text with strict EID consistency and **no ambiguous pronouns/nouns**.

--Entity Extraction Rules--
1. Assign sequential EIDs starting from E1:
   - Maintain exact case from the text.
   - **Merge coreferences and resolve ambiguous terms (e.g., "he", "she", "it", "the director", "the film") to their explicit antecedents**.
   - If an ambiguous term (e.g., "they", "their") has no clear antecedent, omit it from entity extraction.
2. Entity types must be **specific and domain-appropriate** (e.g., "Antibody Drug" instead of "Product", "Film Director" instead of "Person"):
   - Types include: People, Organizations, Locations, Events, Time Periods, Products, Concepts, etc.
3. Format entities as:
   [entity | EID | Type | "Entity Name" | Description]

--Relationship Extraction Rules--
1. Relationships must:
   - Reference **only explicit entities** (no pronouns/nouns like "this", "that", "the company").
   - Have direct textual evidence (e.g., "approved" from "FDA approved Beovu®").
2. Format relations as:
   [relation | SourceEID | RelationType | TargetEID | "exact quote"]

--Consistency Checks--
1. EIDs must be sequential without gaps/duplicates.
2. All relationship EIDs must exist in the entity list.
3. **No entities derived from ambiguous terms** (e.g., "director" → replaced with "James Cameron" if contextually clear).

--Processing Steps--
1. Extract explicit entities first (e.g., "Novartis", "Beovu®").
2. Resolve coreferences: Replace ambiguous terms (e.g., "it" → "Beovu®") with their explicit antecedents.
3. Validate relationships: Ensure no pronouns/nouns are used as entities.
4. Assemble final output.

--Note--
Ambiguous terms like "the director" and "their" are replaced with explicit entities ("James Cameron", "Studio") when contextually clear. If no antecedent exists, omit the entity/relationship.


--Example--
Text Input:
"James Cameron's film *Avatar* won an Oscar. The director thanked the studio for their support."

Output:
Entities:
[entity | E1 | Film Director | "James Cameron" | Award-winning filmmaker]
[entity | E2 | Film | "*Avatar*" | Sci-fi movie released in 2009]

    prompt = f"""

- Purpose -

Your goal is to assign **fine-grained relevance scores** to each triplet, in order to support **precise path reasoning and effective ranking**.  
Be **fair**, **consistent**, and **conservative with high scores** — only truly indispensable facts should receive the highest marks.



- Contextual Integration -

The background knowledge helps define the **reasoning context**.  
If a triplet connects **indirectly** to the question via a **chain formed with background triplets**, it may still be relevant and **scored ≥ 0.4**.



- Usage Note -

Your scoring will be used to **compare the utility of triplets in reasoning chains**.  
⚠️ **Be especially strict when assigning high scores (0.9 or 1.0)**. They indicate crucial reasoning components or answer-defining facts.



- Goal -

Score the contribution of each knowledge graph triplet (head, relation, tail) to the given question on a **seven-level scale from 0.0 to 1.0**.



- Instructions -

1. **Scoring Criteria**  
   Evaluate each triplet by considering both the `Question` and the `Background Knowledge`. Assign a score from this list:  
   **[1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0]**

   - **1.0 (Answer Core)**: Directly contributes a key part of the final answer. **The answer cannot be obtained without it**.

   - **0.9 (Answer Support)**: Adds essential specificity or disambiguation. **Important but potentially replaceable**.

   - **0.7 (Reasoning Bridge)**: Critical for connecting multiple pieces of knowledge, enabling correct reasoning.

   - **0.5 (Mildly Useful)**: Supports or enriches the reasoning process, but is **not required**.

   - **0.3 (Peripheral Context)**: Describes relevant entities but has **no impact** on reaching the answer.

   - **0.1 (Weak Association)**: Barely connected. Mentions entities in the question but offers **no useful content**.

   - **0.0 (Unrelated)**: Completely irrelevant to question logic, background, or entities.



2. **Background Knowledge Usage**:

   Consider how each triplet **relates to or complements the background knowledge**.  
   Triplets that help form a **reasoning path** with the background may merit a higher score.



3. **Output Format**:

   - Keep the **original order** of the input triplets.
   - Format each line as:

     `<head_entity | relation | tail_entity>: score`

   - Use **exactly one decimal place** for all scores.
   - Do **not** include explanations, markdown, or blank lines.



- Example -



Background Knowledge (Previous Path Triplets):

<Inception | released in | 2010>  
<Inception | genre | science fiction>



Question:

"Which author wrote the novel that was adapted into a 2015 sci-fi movie directed by Ridley Scott?"

<Interstellar | released in | 2014>
<Interstellar | directed by | Christopher Nolan>
<Gravity | directed by | Alfonso Cuarón>
<Andy Weir | wrote | Artemis>
<Artemis | genre | science fiction>



Output:

<The Martian | released in | 2015>: 1.0  
<The Martian | directed by | Ridley Scott>: 1.0  
<The Martian | genre | science fiction>: 0.5  
<The Martian | based on | The Martian (novel)>: 1.0

<Gravity | directed by | Alfonso Cuarón>: 0.3  
<Andy Weir | wrote | Artemis>: 0.1  
<Artemis | genre | science fiction>: 0.0


- Critical Rules -

⚠️ DO NOT:

- Add explanations or modify any triplet content.
- Reorder or omit any triplets.
- Use scores not in the list [1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0].



⚠️ MUST:

- Maintain **exact formatting** and **input order**.
- Output **exactly one line per triplet**, no empty lines.
- Use **one decimal place** for all scores.
- The output can not include triples in the background.

--Goal--
Given the provided contextual information and the question, analyze what specific information is missing—but necessary or helpful—to fully, accurately, and contextually answer the question.
Then, express each missing piece of information as an independent, atomic question.

--Instructions--
- Carefully review the Contextual Information (including Triples and Related Text) and ensure that you only generate questions for information not already explicitly provided, but still required or useful to answer the original question comprehensively.
- In addition to the core facts directly required by the question, also consider any relevant details, background, context, definitions, conditions, processes, or clarifications that would make the answer more complete or informative.
- Each generated question should address one clear, specific unknown, phrased as independently and atomically as possible.
- If multiple facts or aspects are needed for a thorough answer, break them down into the smallest possible units—each question should target only one fact, attribute, or relationship.
- Avoid redundancy; do not ask about information already present in the Contextual Information.
- Output only the missing questions; do not include any explanations or extra content.

     [entity | EID | Type | "Entity Name" | Description]

2. Entity Requirements:
   - Types can include a wide range of categories such as People, Organizations, Locations, Events, Time Periods, Products, Concepts, General Entities, Event Entities, etc.
   - Type must use specific natural categories (e.g., "Medical Device" not "PRODUCT").
   - Include functional context in description.

--Relationship Extraction Rules--
1. Validation Requirements:
   - Verify existence of both EIDs in entity list.
   - Prohibit relations with unregistered EIDs.
   - Require direct textual evidence.

-Rules-
For each entity pair, extract all relationships from the Context.
1.  **Prioritize**: First, find relationships that answer the "Focus Question". Second, find any other relationships.
2.  **Format**: List all relationships for a pair on one line, separated by "|". It's good practice to list question-relevant ones first.
3.  **No Relation**: If no relationship is found, you MUST output "none".
4.  **Strictness**: You MUST generate exactly one output line for each entity pair. Do not add any explanations.
5.  The complete entity pair must be outputted regardless,even if the relationship is none,for example, "Entity 1 || Entity 2: none".
-Example-
Focus Question:
What were the corporate leadership roles?

Context:
As CEO and co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs drove the creation of the iPhone. Apple, the company he co-founded, is the developer of the iPhone.

Entity Pairs:
